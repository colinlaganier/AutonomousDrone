The drone is built upon the Diatone Taycan C25 MK2 frame, with 2004 BetaFPV brushless DC Motors and a Flywoo Goku GN745 Flight Controller ESC unit running ArduCopter 4.1.5 firmware. To fit its purpose of a sanitation drone the following pieces were designed and added:
* Transparent Nylon 100mL Water tank, fitted with a refill valve and a silicone coating to ensure watertightness.
* Waterpump and PLA support for spraying of the cleaning solution.
* Acrylic Raspberry Pi Zero support.
* PLA legs.
